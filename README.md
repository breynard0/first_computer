I've been learning VHDL and computer architecture for a little while, and this is my first stab at making an 8 bit computer. The instructions for coding this thing (if you want to for some reason) are in the design.txt file. I admit I've made some weird design choices that I've definitely learned from. I'd appreciate any feedback regarding this (dev@breynard.net)!
